These are a series of phone classification experiments on TIMIT, 
based on benchmarks reported by A. Graves in his PhD thesis. 
The task is formally introduced as Framewise Phoneme Classification in 
Graves' thesis, to make a distinction between this (traditional) approach
and his proposed sequence labeling approach. 

The following algorithms are implemented: 
- MLP
- RNN (vanilla)
- LSTM
- BLSTM
- BRNN
